### Data Structures with TDD

- Singly LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- HashTable
- Set
- Tree
- Graph
- Binary Search Tree

TODO:

- Doubly LinkedList
- Circular Buffer (Circular Queue)
- Other kinds of graphs

### Graphs and Trees

- Implement depth-first search (pre-, in-, post-order) on a tree
- Implement breadth-first search on a tree
- Determine the height of a tree
- Create a binary search tree with minimal height from a sorted array
- Create a linked list for each level of a binary tree
- Check if a binary tree is balanced
- Determine if a tree is a valid binary search tree
- Implement depth-first search on a graph
- Implement breadth-first search on a graph
- Determine if there is a path between two nodes in a graph
- Print a tree using pre-order traversal without recursion
- Determine the lowest common ancestor of two nodes
- Transform a binary tree into a heap
- Implement a right and left rotation on a tree
- Check if a binary tree is binary search tree
